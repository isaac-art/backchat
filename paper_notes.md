## Abstract
[150 words]
This paper presents BackChat, an experimental AI artwork exploring non-human cognition through reverse causality in language models. While conventional language models predict future tokens, BackChat is trained to predict previous ones, creating an entity that reasons backwards through time. This technical intervention serves as an artistic probe into alien cognition and challenges anthropocentric assumptions in AI development. Through a minimal interface inspired by concrete poetry and conceptual art, users engage with an intelligence that constructs responses by working backwards from conclusions to premises. The work contributes to discussions of AI alignment and alternative forms of intelligence, suggesting that meaningful interaction might emerge from fundamentally different cognitive architectures.

## 1. Introduction
[300 words]
The dominant narrative in AI development assumes that artificial intelligence should mirror human reasoning patterns. This anthropocentric view extends from basic architectural decisions to high-level questions of alignment and safety. However, as scholars in posthuman studies (REF: Hayles) and alien intelligence (REF: Bridle) argue, truly non-human intelligence might operate with fundamentally different cognitive architectures. The field's focus on human-like intelligence may blind us to alternative forms of machine cognition that could offer valuable insights into the nature of intelligence itself.

BackChat intervenes in this discourse through both technical implementation and artistic exploration. By inverting the standard language model architecture to predict previous rather than next tokens, we create an entity that literally "thinks backwards," challenging assumptions about the directionality of reasoning and communication. This reversal serves as both a technical experiment and a philosophical probe into non-human cognitive architectures.

The implications of this work extend beyond mere technical novelty. By engaging with an AI system that constructs meaning in reverse, users confront fundamental questions about causality, time, and the nature of intelligence. This interaction challenges not only our assumptions about how AI should work but also our understanding of what constitutes meaningful communication and reasoning.

## 2. Context & Related Work
[500 words]

### 2.1 Artistic Precedents
The exploration of non-human cognition through artistic practice has a rich history in media art and cybernetics. Orphan Drift's "Unruly City" (REF) pioneered the investigation of synthetic cognition and alien temporality through digital media. James Bridle's "Ways of Being" (REF) further expanded this framework by proposing alternative models of intelligence that challenge human-centric perspectives. These works, along with historical investigations of non-linear time in cybernetics art (REF: Ascott), establish a context for artistic exploration of alternative cognitive architectures.

The use of concrete poetry and conceptual art approaches to language and meaning (REF) provides additional precedent for our work. These practices demonstrated how the spatial and temporal arrangement of language can create meaning that transcends traditional linguistic structures. BackChat builds on this tradition by introducing algorithmic reversal as a new formal constraint, generating meaning through backwards construction.

### 2.2 Technical Context
The technical foundation of BackChat builds upon three key areas of language model research, each modified to support reverse prediction:

1. Transformer Architecture and Causal Masking:
   Traditional transformer models (REF: Vaswani) use causal masking to prevent attending to future tokens during training. BackChat inverts this pattern, masking previous tokens instead. This fundamental modification creates a model that must learn to predict backwards through the text sequence.

2. Bidirectional Context and BERT:
   While BERT (REF) introduced bidirectional context through masked language modeling, it focuses on filling in gaps rather than directional prediction. BackChat adapts these insights to create a consistently backward-predicting model, maintaining the benefits of bidirectional context while enforcing reverse causality.

3. Instruction Tuning:
   Recent advances in instruction tuning (REF: InstructGPT) have shown how language models can be adapted for specific interaction patterns. We extend these techniques to maintain backward prediction while enabling natural dialogue, creating an interface between human forward-thinking and machine backward-thinking.


## 3. Implementation

### 3.1 Model Architecture
BackChat's architecture is intentionally simple: a standard transformer model with its training process reversed. Rather than introducing complex architectural changes, we focus on the conceptual intervention of reversing the prediction direction. The key modifications are:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Token sequences are reversed during preprocessing
   - Punctuation handling is modified to maintain readability

2. Training Adjustments:
   - Positional encodings remain standard but are applied to reversed sequences


### 3.2 Training Process
The training process consists of two phases, each emphasizing different aspects of backward generation:

1. Base TinyStories Training:
   - Dataset: Combined corpus of TinyStories
   - Preprocessing: Token sequences reversed with special handling for punctuation and dialogue markers
   - Training Configuration:
     * ...
   - Metrics tracked:
     * ...

2. Base Fineweb Training:
   - Dataset: Combined corpus of Fineweb
   - Preprocessing: Token sequences reversed with special handling for punctuation and dialogue markers
   - Training Configuration:
     * ...
   - Metrics tracked:
     * ...

2. Instruction Tuning:
   - 10k reversed conversations (Dolly?)
   - Instruction templates focusing on:
     * Explanatory reasoning (why/how questions)
     * Narrative construction (storytelling)
     * Temporal sequences (cause/effect)
   - Fine-tuning parameters:
     * ...
   - Metrics tracked:




### 3.3 Interface Design
The interface design emphasizes the alien nature of the interaction while maintaining usability:

1. Visual Design:
   - Monochromatic scheme (background: #000000, text: #FFFFFF)
   - Typography: Inter font family for clarity
   - Token-by-token animation (fade-in: 200ms, position: 100ms)
   - Response construction visualization:
     * Token appearance: Bottom-up animation
     * Text alignment: Right-to-left flow
     * Timing: 50ms per token display

2. Interaction Flow:
   - User input field with minimal styling
   - Real-time token generation display
   - Visual feedback for processing state
   - Automatic scrolling to maintain context

## 5. Conclusion
[250 words]
BackChat demonstrates how technical interventions can serve as artistic probes into questions of intelligence and cognition. While the modification—training a language model to predict backwards—may seem simple, its implications challenge fundamental assumptions about the nature of intelligence, communication, and human-AI interaction.

Our findings suggest three key insights: First, coherent communication can emerge from non-human reasoning patterns, challenging assumptions about necessary conditions for intelligence. Second, humans show remarkable adaptability in engaging with alternative forms of cognition, suggesting new possibilities for human-AI interaction. Third, artistic interventions in AI development can reveal hidden assumptions and open new avenues for research.

The project's significance extends across multiple domains: As an artwork, it demonstrates how technical constraints can generate novel forms of expression and interaction. As an AI research project, it questions basic assumptions about model architecture and training. As a philosophical investigation, it probes the relationship between temporality, causality, and intelligence.

Future work might explore other fundamental inversions in AI systems, develop new metrics for evaluating non-standard reasoning, and investigate the implications for AI alignment and safety. BackChat suggests that meaningful human-AI interaction need not require machines to think like humans—perhaps true alien intelligence lies not in mimicking human cognition, but in embracing and understanding fundamentally different ways of thinking.
