@article{Audry2021269,
	abstract = {Since the 1950s, a range of artists have used artificial agents in their work, in parallel with scientific research in cybernetics, artificial intelligence (AI) and artificial life (AL). In particular, an increasing number of artists work with machine learning and other adaptive systems. Through the author's own engagement with such systems, an analysis of adaptive agents is provided within the broader context of behavior aesthetics. As a result, the author proposes an aesthetic framework for understanding behaviors that accounts for the observer as an adaptive perceiving agent, the unfathomable character of machine learning systems and the morphology of behaviors as a time-based phenomenon. },

	abstract = {With a focus on the last five years, art employing artificial intelligence (AI) has been defined by a spectrum of activity, from the deep learning explorations of neural network researchers to artists critiquing the broader social implications of AI technology. There is an emergence of and increasing access to new tools and techniques for repurposing and manipulating material in unprecedented ways in art.At the same time, there is a dearth of language outside the scientific domain with which to discuss it. A combination of contextual review, comparison of artistic approaches, and practical projects explores speculation that the conceptualrepertoire for remix studies can open up to art enabled by AI and machine learning (ML).This research contributes a practical, conceptual and combinatorial approach for artists who do not necessarily have a grounding in engineering or computer science. A bricolage methodology---described by Annette Markham as combining serendipity, proximity and contingency---reveals the poetics of AI-enabled art in the form of an assemblage of techniques that understands poetics as active making(poiesis) as well as an approach to manipulating language.The poetic capacity of AI/ML is understood as an emergent form of remix technique, with the ML at its core functioning like a remix engine. This practice based research presents several projects founded on an interrelation of body, textBruce Gilchrist. Poetics of Artificial Intelligence in Art Practice: (Mis)apprehended Bodies Remixed as Language. 3 and predictive technology enabled by a human-action-recognition algorithm combined with a natural language generator. A significant number of artistic works have been made around object and facial recognition, while very little (if any) artistactivity has focused on human-action-recognition. For this reason, I concentrated my research there.},

	abstract = { This article reflects on how the ingression of computation in culture has not only transformed media into algorithmic devices but has also, more importantly, led to the automation of the most precious faculty of the human, namely, reasoning. This article problematizes the tout court refusal of algorithmic thinking as thinking and suggests that we are witnessing the advance of a dynamic form of automated reasoning, exposing the limits of the critical approach toward the calculative. The article points out that the alliance between algorithmic automation and the digital infrastructure of neoliberalism is not without significance, but attention must be paid to the specific posthuman form of cognitive capitalism. },

	abstract = {The objective of this workshop is to rethink `making' AI through a focus on the physical materials involved in designing, producing, and running artificially intelligent systems. The recent manufacturing chip shortage illuminates digital technologies' physicality and the fragility of the commodity and production networks that underpin the AI systems our cities, governments, and workplaces have come to rely on. Those that are conventionally considered to `make' AI through the design of AI systems are largely divorced from AI's materiality and the craft of making AI. Corresponding research on AI and creativity focuses primarily on the digital artefacts, potentials and imaginaries AI creates, and less so on the social and material artefacts embedded in its ability to create. We hope to push participants beyond the theoretical knowing of AI materiality to tactile knowing through a practice-based approach to `making' AI. Reorienting the focus of AI to materials and the supply chain as sites of creative intervention could leverage the potential of sensory, tactile experiences to spur reimaginations of AI technologies and infrastructures. Ultimately, the aim is to advance creative approaches to the design of AI systems through the craft of making them.},

@article{MILLER20191,
	abstract = {There has been a recent resurgence in the area of explainable artificial intelligence as researchers and practitioners seek to provide more transparency to their algorithms. Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/3430524.3442704,
	abstract = {Since the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), researchers have asked how intelligent computing systems could interact with and relate to their users and their surroundings, leading to debates around issues of biased AI systems, ML black-box, user trust, user's perception of control over the system, and system's transparency, to name a few. All of these issues are related to how humans interact with AI or ML systems, through an interface which uses different interaction modalities. Prior studies address these issues from a variety of perspectives, spanning from understanding and framing the problems through ethics and Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspectives to finding effective technical solutions to the problems. But what is shared among almost all those efforts is an assumption that if systems can explain the how and why of their predictions, people will have a better perception of control and therefore will trust such systems more, and even can correct their shortcomings. This research field has been called Explainable AI (XAI). In this studio, we take stock on prior efforts in this area; however, we focus on using Tangible and Embodied Interaction (TEI) as an interaction modality for understanding ML. We note that the affordances of physical forms and their behaviors potentially can not only contribute to the explainability of ML systems, but also can contribute to an open environment for criticism. This studio seeks to both critique explainable ML terminology and to map the opportunities that TEI can offer to the HCI for designing more sustainable, graspable and just intelligent systems.},

@article{Baradaran20247,
	abstract = {This paper delves into the intricate relationship between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the art ecosystem, emphasizing the need for a decolonizing approach in the face of AI's growing influence. It argues that the development of AI is not just a technological leap but also a significant cultural and societal moment, akin to the advent of moving images that Walter Benjamin famously analyzed. The paper examines how AI, particularly in its current oligarchical and corporate-driven form, perpetuates and magnifies the existing social inequalities, thereby necessitating a critical and radical rethinking of its role in society and the arts. At the heart of the discussion is the concept of AI as a broad term encompassing various forms of machine intelligence, from natural language processing to computer vision. The paper criticizes the dominant anthropocentric view of intelligence and creativity, proposing a more inclusive approach that considers the diverse forms of intelligence present in other species and potentially in AI itself. It underscores the role of AI in shaping the art ecosystem, not just in the creative process but also in gatekeeping and decision-making. The paper proposes a framework for decolonizing AI in the art ecosystem, focusing on four key tasks: recognizing access as a form of power, understanding and addressing biases inherent in AI, assessing the impact of AI on marginalized communities, and challenging dominant narratives and epistemologies to create space for alternative voices and perspectives. It emphasizes the need for artists and the art community to engage actively with AI, shaping its development towards more equitable and just outcomes. In conclusion, the paper calls for a radical reimagination of AI's role in society and the arts, advocating for a future where AI is not just about technological advancement but also about fostering a more inclusive, equitable, and creatively diverse world. It invites artists, thinkers, and innovators to join in this journey of reimagining and reshaping the future of AI and the art ecosystem. {\copyright} The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2023.},

@conference{Hemment2023931,
	abstract = {Recent advances in diffusion models and large language models have underpinned a new generation of powerful and accessible tools, and some of the most publicly visible applications are for artistic endeavour. Such tools, however, provide little scope for deeper understanding of AI systems, while the growing public interest in them can eclipse notice of the vibrant community of artists who have long worked with other forms of AI. We explore the potential for AI Art - particularly work in which AI is both tool and topic - to facilitate public AI literacies and consider how tactics developed before the current generative AI boom have continued relevance today. We look at the strategies of critical AI artists to scaffold public understanding of AI and enhance legibility for non-experts. This paper also investigates how collaborations between artists and AI researchers and designers can illuminate key technical and social issues relevant to the development of AI. The study entailed workshops between three professional artists who work with AI and a cross-disciplinary set of academic participants. This paper reports on these workshops and presents the intentions and strategies expressed by the artists, as well as insights of relevance to the research community on public AI literacies. We find that critical AI art can link underlying technical systems to structural issues of power and facilitate experiential learning that is situated and embodied, valuing interpretation over explanation. The findings also demonstrate the importance of transdisciplinary conversations around art, ethics and the political economy of AI technologies and how these dialogues may feed into AI design processes. {\copyright} 2023 ACM.},
